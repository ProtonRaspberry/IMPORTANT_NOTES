# MY NOTES

### These are my notes

---

This repository only has notes that I have taken while
learning how to program.

It lists important things I would like to remember as
as useful commands.

If you forget "how to git", here is a [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-git/worksheet/)

### As a summary:
* (edit or add a new file to IMPORTANT_NOTES folder)
* cd IMPORTANT_NOTES		*You must be in the folder!*
* git add --all			*adds all files*
* git commit -am		*commits changes*
* git push -u origin master	*pushes all files and changes to github*

end
